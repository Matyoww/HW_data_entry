# HW Catalog Entry

This is a personal vibe-code mini-project to cataloging and inventory system for my hotwheels collection.

Run the Streamlit app:

```
uv run streamlit run src/data_entry_page.py
```

Required fields:
- Toy #
- Name
- Series
- Rarity

For `Exclusive` rarity, `Exclusive Description` is also required.
